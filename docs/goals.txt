Goals for scripting


The primary goal of scripting virtualbox is the 
automated startup, shutdown, of virtualbox and 
any associated machines in a completely automated
fashion.  i.e. Logout walk way and all is good.

Automated started in the morning is highly 
desirable.

Being on windows 10 this means using the equivilent
of whatever a windows cron job is.
